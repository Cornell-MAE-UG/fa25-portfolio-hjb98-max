This project involved designing a two-dimensional lifting mechanism within a 150 cm by 50 cm workspace using a rigid bar, three pin supports, and a linear actuator selected from an industrial catalog. The goal was to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height, assuming all components were rigid and frictionless. By analyzing the geometry and static equilibrium of different bar and actuator configurations, the design optimized the actuator’s mechanical advantage to convert limited axial thrust into large lifting force. The project demonstrated how actuator placement and linkage geometry determine both lifting capacity and motion range, highlighting the trade-offs between force, stroke, and stability in mechanical design
