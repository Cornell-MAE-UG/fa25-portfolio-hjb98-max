Hello my name is Hayden Bergschneider and I am a second year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am the business lead of Cornell Hyperloop where I manage a team of 12 people to handle all business needs for our project team of 50+ members. I am also a member of the Cornell boxing club. Outside of school I also started a business that specializes in baked goods for events and catering and in my free time I enjoy hiking and fishing. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
